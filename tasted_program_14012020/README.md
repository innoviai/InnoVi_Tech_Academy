# InnoVi_Tech_Academy Tasted Program (14 Jan 2020)

# Dash Online Data Science Dashboard using Plotly

## Topic: Interactive Dashboards for Data Science <br />
In this tasted program, we are going to create an online Data Science Dashboard. It can conduct a powerful way of communicating the results of a Data Science project. A good Dashboard can:<br />
-	Summarize the main results of a data analysis.<br />
-	Enable the customers/company managers to test how varying some parameters can affect a certain outcome.<br />
-	Fetch continuously new data to update its graphs and summaries.<br />
-	Allow us to make predictions online using either pre-trained Machine Learning models or training them online.<br />
